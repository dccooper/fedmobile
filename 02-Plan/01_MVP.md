#The Minimum Viable Product
Your first goal in the **Plan** phase is to test the hypotheses you made in the **Conceive** phase. Ideally you want to invest as little as possbile in your tests until you have data to cofirm that you're on the right track.

##What is an MVP
An Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is about finding the least amount of functionality you can create in order to test your hypothesis about your product. Do users want this functionality? Do users want it delivered in this way? Is there something we're missing? Ideally, you would want to find out the answers to these questions *before* you release your product to the market. 

The best way that product developers have found to do this is through the MVP. For example, when Tony Hiseh was starting [Zappos.com](http://www.zappos.com) he didn't start by building a complete buisness website with automatic ordering and customer fullfillment to sell shoes. He first needed to know whether people wanted to buy shoes online at all! So he set up a simple webpage with pictures of shoes and, when someone wanted to buy a pair, he went to a nearby store, bought a pair and put them in the mail. Considering the size of Zappos today, Tony was clearly right in guessing that people wanted to buy shoes online. But he was also smart to test his assumption in ht emost basic way possible before paying for coders to build an entire ordering and shipping infrastructure.

##MVP vs MVE
Some experts prefer the term "Minimum Viable Experiment" to the more traditional MVP. They argue that you don't strictly need a product to test your hypotheses. Rather you just need to figure out how to get the data you need a  The Zappos example mentioned above is a good example. Rather than trying to build out a giant customer fulfillment system or even the beginnings of one, all that was needed was a simple webpage and email.

##Does it have to be code?
So looking at it in terms of the words "minimum viable" you can accomplish this is other ways rather than as a product, you can user paper protoypes, wireframes or interactive protoypes to test your idea. This requires much less investment in terms of time and resources. 

Products like FluidUI and Pixate allow you to build interactive protoypes that can work on a desktop or mobile device with little to no coding expereince necessary. 

##Summary
Again the idea to keep in mind, that is at the core of the MVP concept is "How can I test my assumptions about my product before I get too invested?" Whether it is a prototype application or a simple wireframe, you absolutely *must* test your ideas *before* you build your final product.
