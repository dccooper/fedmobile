#The Minimum Viable Product
Your first goal in the planning phase is to test the hypotheses you made in the Concieve phase. Ideally you want to invest as little as possbile in your tests until you have data to cofirm that you're on the right track.

##What is an MVP
An Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is about finding the least amount of functionality you can create in 

##MVP vs MVE
Some experts prefer the term "Minimum Viable Experiment" to the more traditional MVP. They argue that you don't strictly need a product to test your hypotheses. Rather you just need to figure out how to get the data you need a  The Zappos example mentioned above is a good example. Rather than trying to build out a giant customer fulfillment system or even the beginnings of one, all that was needed was a simple webpage and email.

##Does it have to be code?
So looking at it as a Minimum Viable Experiment rather than as a product, you can user paper protoypes, wireframs or interactive protoypes to test your idea. This requires much less investment in terms of time and resources. 

Products like FluidUI and Pixate allow you to build interactive protoypes that can work on a desktop or mobile device with little to no coding expereince necessary.
