# Technical Considerations

## Cross-platform vs. Native App

Although cross-platform apps have limitations, new programming framworks like [Ionic]() are helping to increase both the app's responsiveness and ease of building applications for multiple platforms.

## APIs
API stands for Application Programming Interface. Essentially it's about how you can push and pull data to and from your app from external sources.
