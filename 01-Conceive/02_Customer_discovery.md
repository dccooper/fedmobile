# Customer Discovery

**Customer Discovery**
The best applications are those that come from a complete and throughout understanding of a potential users problems and then simply and effectively create solutions to address them.

In the private sector this is known as **Product-Market Fit**. That is, your product is offering exactly what the market wants - or at least does it better, faster or cheaper than current offerings. 

In order to achieve this, you have to gather data. Lots of it. Data about how current solutions are failing potential users. Data about how well your idea fits their needs. Data about features they expect that you had no idea about. 

Most product don't fail because of poor technology - or even poor design. Rather they fail because they do not fundamentally meet what a user wants. They fail because no one uses their product. To make it worse, most people don't find this out until after they have already built and launched a product.

**Test your hypothesis**
So in order to avoid this, you need to get outside your office and engage with potential users. 

There are many ways that you can do this ranging from formal focus groups down to cornering whomever you can with a clipboard in hand. The important thing is to get unbiased feedback directly from your potential users. This data is what should you use to drive your product decisions and backup those decisions to your bosses. 

**Questions to ask yourself about your idea**
- Is it clearly related to my line of work?
- Does it have a valid evidence base?
- Why is it best suited to a mobile platform? 
  - Would it work equally as well on the web?
  - Is it meant to be used on the go or will people mostly use it from their office?
  - Does it always or regularly need to be connected to the internet to work?
- What features would a mobile app allow you to do that you cannot currently get from paper or an electronic document?
- How often will the information need to be updated?
  - Who will do that?
  - How long will it take?
- Is there already an app that you can point to that is like what you want?
  - If so, what makes your app different?

## Good uses for mobile apps
According to the book *Mobile First* by Luke Wrobelewski, apps work for these general uses:
  - **Lookup/Find:** I need an answer to something now—frequently related to my current location in the world
  - **Explore/Play:** I have some time to kill and just want a few idle time distractions
  - **Check In/Status:** Something important to me keeps changing or updating and I want to stay on top of it.
  - **Edit/Create:** I need to get something done now that can’t wait.

Does your idea align to one of the above uses?

## Finding the Voice of the User
Again, it's your users who should be calling the tune when it comes to your product. Your boss may like green, but if your users like blue - the product has to be blue. (This why it's important to make data-driven decisions whenver you can.) That said there are many different ways to find out what your users need.

Finding the Voice of the User can involve many different tasks: Market research, informal interviews, focus groups or even online tools like Intercom and ???. Ultimately, you'll choose the one that's right for you but try as many as you can, and as cheaply as you can. Sometimes you have to just go hunting. For example, if you're making a medically oriented tool, it can be really difficult to interview medical providers during their workdays as they are often very busy. However, if you put up a sign at a conference or other professional gathering, you'll have no end of people volunteering to tell you about their problems that you could solve. 

### Needs analysis / Focus groups


### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)
Another way to understand what your users need from their perspecitive is by using the "jobs-to-be-done" framework. This framework gets you thinking beyond a specific solution and looking instead at the "job" your user is "hiring" a solution to fill. In other words, say you're trying to sell drill bits to a customer. You could think about making differnt kinds of drill bits, in differnet sizes or new ways to market them. By using the JTBD framework, you flip the idea by looking, not at a given solution but at the job the user is trying to accomplish. In this case, the user of a drill bit, but rather to make a given size hole in something.
