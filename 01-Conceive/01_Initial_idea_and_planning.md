## Market / Gap Analysis
As good stewards of federal monies, before we try and build a new product we should first see if anyhting like it already exists on the market. Finding an exisiting Commercial- (COTS) or Governmental- (GOTS) off-the-shelf product is far preferable than trying to build your own. 

Similarly, if there is an exisiting solution that is 75-80% of what you're proposing, you're going to be more hard pressed to make the case for spending the money just to get that last bit. 

So undertaking a throurogh market analyisis is a key step before beginning a new product. In this way you can see what products are available, how they are being executed and what standard features users may be expecting.

You can also learn how NOT to build a specific feature or find specific parts of a product that you DON'T want by looking at what's available. 

## Finding the Voice of the User
Again, it's your users who should be calling the tune when it comes to your product. Your boss may like green, but if your users like blue - the product has to be blue. (This why it's important to make data-driven decisions whenver you can.) That said there are many different ways to find out what your users need.

### Needs analysis / Focus groups


### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)
Another way to understand what your users need from their perspecitive is by using the "jobs-to-be-done" framework. This framework gets you thinking beyond a specific solution and looking instead at the "job" your user is "hiring" a solution to fill. In other words, say you're trying to sell drill bits to a customer. You could think about making differnt kinds of drill bits, in differnet sizes or new ways to market them. By using the JTBD framework, you flip the idea by looking, not at a given solution but at the job the user is trying to accomplish. In this case, the user of a drill bit, but rather to make a given size hole in something. 

You can learn more about the JTBD framework and how it's used here:

## Things to keep in mind

### Be Data Driven
Whenever possible, it's a good idea to try and back up your product descisions with supporting data. It's easy to argue about a decision when it's based on people's opinions; it's much harder to argue, however, when you have supporting data that supports your decisions.  

>"No facts exist inside the building, only opinions." 
>â€“Steve Blank

The data you'll need for effective product decisions is most often found outside your office. This means finding ways to reach out to your users. Whether through surveys or finding robust analytic methods, you should always look outside your team for answers first. 

### Embrace your Constraints
We all know that the private sector can take risks and use products that we as federal employees and public servants cannot. But rather than railing against these limitations we can instead embrace them and use tham to drive a better product. After all, if you can make *anything*, where do you even start?

### Product vs. Project Management
As mentioned in the README, this guide is based on the format laided out in the Product Mangement Body of Knowledge (ProdBOK). You have likely heard of a Project Manager, but possibly not a Product Manager. The difference is that, while *project* managers may come and go throughout the development of different projects (Technical project managers, promotion project managers, etc.) focused on a single prodcut, the *product* manager is responsible for the entire product throughout the lifecycle.

> Product managers are often described as the "mini-CEO" of a given product.
