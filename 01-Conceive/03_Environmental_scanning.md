# Environmental Scanning

**Overview**  
Before you begin work on your app, it is important to conduct an environmental scan - a thorough search of all available apps that have features and functions similar to yours. 

This is important for several reasons:

1. If you duplicate something that already exists in the private sector, you will need sufficient justification as to why your product is necessary.

  Given the initial expenditure of funds for building and the ongoing technical and administrative costs of maintaining an application, the potential product would have to offer substantial benefits over an existing private sector app. Otherwise, licensing the private app for the DoD should be considered. 

2. It is important to see how popular apps are accomplishing common features and functions.
By doing a scan of popular application on the marketplaces with similar kinds of functions, you can gather ideas about how to best implement them in your application.

  Learning from and applying as many existing and proven design ideas can significantly help when working under budgetary constraints. 

## Market / Gap Analysis
As good stewards of federal monies, before we try and build a new product we should first see if anyhting like it already exists on the market. Finding an exisiting Commercial- (COTS) or Governmental- (GOTS) off-the-shelf product is far preferable than trying to build your own. 

Similarly, if there is an exisiting solution that is 75-80% of what you're proposing, you're going to be more hard pressed to make the case for spending the money just to get that last bit. 

So undertaking a throurogh market analyisis is a key step before beginning a new product. In this way you can see what products are available, how they are being executed and what standard features users may be expecting.

You can also learn how NOT to build a specific feature or find specific parts of a product that you DON'T want by looking at what's available.
