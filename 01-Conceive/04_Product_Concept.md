# Product Concept

## Documentation
There are a wide variety of formats that your product documentation could take - webpages, internal wikis or Word documents - it just depends on the needs of your specific product or organization. That said, there are a few general things you'll need to capture. 

### Major Task Flows
It's a good idea to map out - either though a simple wireframe or more complex UML - the major tasks of your application. How are people going to initally use the app? What are the major functions and how will people use them from start to finish? The major reason to do this is because, by actually walking through them with your team - experts in usability technology and design - you'll find that they don't always work the way that you think they do.

### General information
Who started this project? Who in the organization has worked on the project? As people and orgnaziations change, it's important to document this kind of organizational knowledge and not let it leave with people as they move off the project. 

## Summary
Documentation is a balance of resources - it is valuable but can also take time away from other important tasks. You don't want to document more than you absolutely need to. Try to think of it is way, if someone has the app, what other documentation would someone reading it need based on their role (user, stakeholder, technical or content SME).
