# Environmental Scanning

**Overview**  
Before you begin work on your app, it is important to conduct an environmental scan - a thorough search of all available apps that have features and functions similar to yours. 

This is important for several reasons:

1. If you duplicate something that already exists in the private sector, you will need sufficient justification as to why your product is necessary.

  Given the initial expenditure of funds for building and the ongoing technical and administrative costs of maintaining an application, the potential product would have to offer substantial benefits over an existing private sector app. Otherwise, licensing the private app for the DoD should be considered. 

2. It is important to see how popular apps are accomplishing common features and functions.
By doing a scan of popular application on the marketplaces with similar kinds of functions, you can gather ideas about how to best implement them in your application.

  Learning from and applying as many existing and proven design ideas can significantly help when working under budgetary constraints.
