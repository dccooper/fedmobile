**COCOMO Model**

The Constructive Cost Model [(COCOMO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COCOMO) has been found by T2 to provide estimates that closely align with final project numbers when building mobile apps in the Federal Government. 

## Use Cases

A use case is a requirement found in the Agile Software methodology. it is a high level view of a requirement, usually based around a story or discreet action that a use needs or wants to accomplish.

User stories typically follow the format of "As a **[type of user]** I want to **[desired action]** so that I can **[context/reason for the action.]**"

Because they are a) non-technical and b) usually follow a narrative approach to defining product specifications, they can be a great way to start thinking about and scoping out your product.
