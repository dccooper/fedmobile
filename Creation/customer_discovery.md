# Customer Discovery

**Customer Discovery**
The best applications are those that come from a complete and throughout understanding of a potential users problems and then simply and effectively create solutions to address them.

In the private sector this is known as **Product-Market Fit**. That is, your product is offering exactly what the market wants - or at least does it better, faster or cheaper than current offerings. 

In order to achieve this, you have to gather data. Lots of it. Data about how current solutions are failing potential users. Data about how well your idea fits their needs. Data about features they expect that you had no idea about. 

Most product don't fail because of poor technology - or even poor design. Rather they fail because they do not fundamentally meet what a user wants. They fail because no one uses their product. To make it worse, most people don't find this out until after they have already built and launched a product.

**Test your hypothesis**
So in order to avoid this, you need to get outside your office and engage with potential users. For our mobile apps, this means patients and providers.

**Providers**

**Patients**

**Questions to ask yourself about your idea**
- Is it clearly related to Psychological Health or Traumatic Brain Injury?
- Does it have a valid scientific evidence base?
- Why is it best suited to a mobile platform? 
  - Would it work equally as well on the web?
  - Is it meant to be used on the go or will people mostly use it from their office?
  - Does it always or regularly need to be connected to the internet to work?
- What features would a mobile app allow you to do that you cannot currently get from paper or a PDF?
- How often will the information need to be updated?
  - Who will do that?
  - How long will it take?
- Apps work best for the following uses
  - **Lookup/Find:** I need an answer to something now—frequently related to my current location in the world
  - **Explore/Play:** I have some time to kill and just want a few idle time distractions
  - **Check In/Status:** Something important to me keeps changing or updating and I want to stay on top of it.
  - **Edit/Create:** I need to get something done now that can’t wait.
- Does your idea align to one of the above uses?
- Is there already an app that you can point to that is like what you want?
  - If so, what makes your app different?
