###Overview
Because of differing use cases and form factors, the success and functioning of mobile applications are different from websites in terms of analytics. Further, because of the unique use cases for each application in the Mobile Applications program, each application will need to have different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to determine success.

To date, many organizations have predominately used only very basic analytics such as “number of downloads” as their primary indicator of application success. However, because this number only indicates the total number of people who have downloaded the application to date, it can at best only give an indication of the reach of the application but provides little information on the actual usage. According to a [2014 report](http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/research-publications/adults/adults-media-lit-14/?utm_source=updates&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=media-lit-adults-14), up to 2/3rd of apps that are downloaded to a mobile device are subsequently never used. For this reason, these kinds of very basic analytics can only indicate interest in your application. They tell you nothing about if your application is performing as expected or if it is actually engaging users. 

Even more challenging is that, since each application differs in its expected use, each application with need to focus on different KPIs in order to determine success. For example, an application like [T2 MoodTracker](http://t2health.dcoe.mil/apps/t2-mood-tracker) is intended to be used multiple times per day. The number of Daily Average Users then, would be a good metric of success - a higher number indicating more use of the app on a daily basis. On the other hand, an application like [mTBI Pocket Guide] is not likely to be used every day, rather it is designed to stay on the phone until needed on the odd occasion. Even further, apps like [Breathe2Relax] are not intended to be used on a consistent basis - so if it were used as intended, the number of Daily Average Users should naturally fluctuate over time as people acquire the skill and no longer need the application.

Ultimately, governement mobile applications will need to develop their own unique models for measuring return-on-investment and cost-benefit-analyses that are distinct from those in the private sector.
