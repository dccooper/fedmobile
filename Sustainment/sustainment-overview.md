###Overview
Because of differing use cases and form factors, the success and functioning of mobile applications are different from websites in terms of analytics. Further, because of the unique use cases for each application in the Mobile Applications program, each application will need to have different Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to determine success.

To date, T2 has predominately used “number of downloads” as their primary indicator of application success. However, because this number only indicates the total number of people who have downloaded the application to date, it can at best give an indication of the reach of the application but provides little information on the actual usage. According to a [2014 report](http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/other/research-publications/adults/adults-media-lit-14/?utm_source=updates&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=media-lit-adults-14), up to 2/3rd of apps that are downloaded to a mobile device are subsequently never used. For this reason, the number of downloads can only indicate interest in, not successfully engaging users with, your application.

Even more challenging than the lack of a unifying metric is that, since each application differs in its expected use, different combinations of KPIs would need to be used for each application. For example, T2 MoodTracker is intended to be used multiple times per day. The number of Daily Average Users then, would be a good metric of success - a higher number indicating more use of the app on a daily basis. On the other hand, an application like mTBI Pocket Guide is not likely to be used every day, rather it is designed to stay on the phone until needed on the odd occasion. Even further, apps like Breathe2Relax are not intended to be used on a consistent basis - so if it were used as intended, the number of Daily Average Users should naturally fluctuate over time as people acquire the skill and no longer need the application.

Ultimately, it will be the ROI and CBA models currently being developed that will provide the best direct comparison of application performance. Because these models will serve as the unifying factor, the KPIs can be more tailored to focus on application performance in terms of how they compare with their intended use.
Additionally, by analyzing applications according to their expected use, both by how we can expect a patient to use the app as compared to a provider, we can potentially segment our audience and get a better look at how different classes of users are engaging with the app.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Again, for each application there will be a unique series of metrics that will determine whether or not the application is performing as expected.

This means that for each application, you will first need to work out how a user will optimally or typically use an application. 

Once you have a usage model, you can then determine what KPIs align with it and will be of most use to you in monitoring performance.

**Definitions of Specific KPIs**

*Total Number of Downloads* - The total number of times the application has been downloaded and installed to a device. 

Downloads are a simple indicator of the reach of an application - how many people have been exposed to the application. On it's own, it can provide little more than that. Combining it with other KPIs can yield more informative results.

*Retention rates* - How many users continued to use the application after downloading it after a given time interval, typically 1, 7 and 30 days.

*Average active users* - Number of users who used the application at least once in a given time period.

Depending on the expected use of your application, you may want to look at a combination of the number of Daily, Weekly or Monthly Average Active users.

*Session length and interval* - How long and how often was the application used.

Did users use it frequently but for short periods of time? Or did they use it for longer, but accessed the application less often?

*Application Load time* - How long the application takes to load.





###Application Usage Model
**Overview**

**Example - T2 MoodTracker**

*Providers* 
With Providers, we can expect to see erratic use, taking place for 5 minutes or less at a time, with primarily use of the application taking place during work hours. They are more likely to use iOS, and unlikely to use each function more than once per use session, since their primary use will likely be to demonstrate the application for patients.

*Patients* 
With Patients, optimally we would expect to see daily use, 2-3+ times per day. We would also expect to see them review the overall mood chart one or more times per week.
