#Creating Applications in the Federal Government.

So, you're working in the federal government and want to create a mobile application. But you have nowhere to start and have a lot of questions.

* How do I make sure I'm building something people will want?
* What's the difference between native vs. cross-platform development?
* How do I know my app will work on different devices?

We hope that this repo will serve as a starting guide for you to incorporate some of the best practices from the private sector.
