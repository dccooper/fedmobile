#Creating Applications in the Federal Government.

So, you're working in the federal government and want to create a mobile application. But you have nowhere to start and have a lot of questions.

* How do I make sure I'm building something people will want?
* What's the difference between native vs. cross-platform development?
* How do I know my app will work on different devices?

The purpose of this repo is to serve as a starting guide for you to incorporate some of the best practices from the private sector.

The sections of this guide follow the Product Management Lifecycle as laid out in the Product Manager's Desk Reference. 

We have adapted it with lessons learned from working within the federal government.
